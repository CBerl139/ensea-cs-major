[ensea.fr](https://ensea.fr/)

# How to launch the code

When in src directory :
```
& gcc ./questionX/questionX.c -o enseash
```
2. Execution :
When in src directory :
```
& ./questionX/enseash
```

Where X is the number of the question

To exit the shell :

# What this code does
This code implements a tiny shell (called "enseash") inside the linux shell.
It allows you to execute functions, with multiple arguments, and outputs the function's output, along with its return code and execution time.
